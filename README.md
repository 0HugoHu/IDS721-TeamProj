# IDS721-TeamProj
IDS721 Cloud Computing - Team Final Project

## Option A:

*   Build a containerized or PaaS machine learning prediction model and deploy it in a scalable, and elastic platform:
    *   Options:
        *   ML Framework
            *   Sklearn, MXNet, PyTorch or Keras/TF
        *   Model
            *   Your own supervised ML prediction model or a Kaggle Prediction Model
        *   Platform
            *   Flask + Kubernetes deployed to EKS (Elastic Kubernetes) or Google Kubernetes Engine
            *   Flask + Google App Engine
            *   AWS Sagemaker
            *   Other (Upon Request)
*   Verify Elastic Scale-Up Performance via Load Test with [Locust](https://locust.io/), [Loader.io](https://loader.io), or a similar load test framework. (Start with 1 container or endpoint) and verify 2 or more inference endpoints scale up to 1K requests per second.
*   Deliverables:
    *   Source code in Github Project with README.md file that explains the project.
    *   Demo video showing project scaling to 1K+ requests served by multiple endpoints that scale-up.   The video should be between **one** to **five** minutes.  Videos over five minutes or under one minute will have points deducted.
    *   **One** to **five** minute in-person class presentation
*   Reference Project:
    *   [https://github.com/noahgift/container-revolution-devops-microservices](https://github.com/noahgift/container-revolution-devops-microservices)
*   (Optional) Reference Videos:
    *   Data Engineering with Python and AWS Lambda:  [https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/data-engineering-with/9780135964330](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/data-engineering-with/9780135964330)
    *   Building AI & ML Applications on Google Cloud Platform:  [https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/building-ai-applications/9780135973462](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/building-ai-applications/9780135973462)
    *   AWS Certified Machine Learning: _[https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/aws-certified-machine/9780135556597](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/aws-certified-machine/9780135556597)

## Option B:  
Pick Project from Practical MLOPs Book-Appendix E. Building a Technical Portfolio for MLOps

* [Appendix E. Building a Technical Portfolio for MLOps](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-mlops/9781098103002/app05.html#idm45917434442872)

#### Additional considerations for final project

* Are you utilizing each person for what they do best:  Presentation, Coding, Math/Statistics/Data Science?
* Is this project resume worthy?
* How does the final presentation make your team look?
* Could this project land you a dream job?

## (Optional, but recommended:)

* The video should be at least 1080p with 16:9 aspect ratio.
* Consider recording with a  low-cost mic like follows:  https://www.amazon.com/Samson-Mic-Portable-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B001R76D42/ or equivalent at 48 kHz to 96 kHz.
* Build this into public Github portfolio with links to your videos in YouTube.
